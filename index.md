# Qingping Yang
---

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS), 
advised by [Prof. Ping Luo](https://ping-luo.github.io/). 
Before that, I received B.S. in Software Engineering at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2017.

My research interest includes Table Understanding, Structured Information Extraction and Multimodal Learning.
